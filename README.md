A motivated second-year Computer Science and Software Engineering student at The University of Liverpool. This is a one-stop repository to showcase all of my previous projects.

Older projects are in folders on this Github. Current projects have their own repositories. In both cases they are linked below.


## Portfolio Projects
----

### 1. Text-Based Route Planner
----

A simple Python application that utilizes TransportAPI to provide text based navigation

### 2. pyTson Teamspeak AI Responder
----

An addon script created for pyTson. pyTson is an addon that enables users to create and utilize Python scripts within the Teamspeak 3 Client (A VOIP solution widely used by gaming communities).

### 3. Swift IOS Applications
----

I have only recently learnt swift, and am creating small apps to expand my skills. I have linked a seperate repository, containing all my recent apps. You can also gain an insight in to the way I approach solutions to problems, by looking at the commit history (just not the hundreds of changes I make to the readme.md markdown!)

### 4. Lovebox
----

Coming Soon...

### 5. Arma 3 Scripts
----

A collection of Arma 3 scripts I have created for the AltisLife gamemode, available for public use.

### 6. More To Be Added
----

I have a lot of projects to be added here, however I need to locate and remove API Keys and identifiable information etc from them first.

Projects to be added include:
1. MyPicke Charity Search
2. Ceasar Cipher Decrypt using Letter Frequency Analysis

## Future Projects
----

I love playing around with projects that require hardware and software. Some projects I really want to make but haven't got round to yet include:
1. I am looking in to buying a 3D printer to make loads of cool shells/cases for future projects, one of which could be quadcopter made from motors and an adapter Raspberry Pi
2. I have recently been playing around with my DJI Tello quadcopter, and figuring out how to use the API. Once I am familliar with it, I might use the drone as a way to look in to machine learning with Python, something I have wanted to do for a while, but haven't had a starting point/idea. I might make a program that allows the Tello to follow faces, track objects etc.
3. Don't ask why, but I have a hamster and am passionate about their welfare. There are so many people who buy them, thinking they are toys and don't know how to care for their needs. I might make and try to release an IOS app for new Hamster owners with in depth guides on how to keep them safe and happy.
4. Having studied the principles of networking at University, I want to try out socket programming in Python. I plan to at some point create a Stop and Wait, and Go Back N protocol that can be tested on two machines running python programs.
