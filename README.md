A motivated second-year Computer Science and Software Engineering student at The University of Liverpool. This is a one-stop repository to showcase all of my previous projects.

Older projects are in folders on this Github. Current projects have their own repositories. In both cases they are linked below.


## Portfolio Projects

### 1. Text-Based Route Planner

### 3. Swift IOS Applications
----

I have only recently learnt swift, and am creating small apps to expand my skills. I have linked a seperate repository, containing all my recent apps. You can also gain an insight in to the way I approach solutions to problems, by looking at the commit history (just not the hundreds of changes I make to the readme.md markdown!)

A collection of Arma 3 scripts I have created for the AltisLife gamemode, available for public use.

### 5. More To Be Added
----

I have a lot of projects to be added here, however I need to locate and remove API Keys and identifiable information etc from them first.

Projects to be added include:
1. MyPicke Charity Search
2. Ceasar Cipher Decrypt using Letter Frequency Analysis

## Future Projects


I love playing around with projects that require hardware and software. Some projects I really want to make but haven't got round to yet include:

1. I have recently been playing around with my DJI Tello quadcopter, and figuring out how to use the API. Once I am familliar with it, I might use the drone as a way to look in to machine learning with Python, something I have wanted to do for a while, but haven't had a starting point/idea. I might make a program that allows the Tello to follow faces, track objects etc.
