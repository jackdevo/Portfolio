A motivated second-year Computer Science and Software Engineering student at The University of Liverpool. This is a one-stop repository to showcase all of my previous projects.

Older projects are in folders on this Github. Current projects have their own repositories. In both cases they are linked below.

----

### 3. Swift IOS Applications
----

I have only recently learnt swift, and am creating small apps to expand my skills. I have linked a seperate repository, containing all my recent apps. You can also gain an insight in to the way I approach solutions to problems, by looking at the commit history (just not the hundreds of changes I make to the readme.md markdown!)

### 4. Lovebox

Coming Soon...


### 5. More To Be Added
----

I have a lot of projects to be added here, however I need to locate and remove API Keys and identifiable information etc from them first.
