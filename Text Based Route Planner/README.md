# Text Based Route Planner

![](https://img.shields.io/github/followers/jackdevo?style=social)

A simple Python application that utilises TransportAPI to provide text based navigation

### Disclaimer
----
As of testing on 12/12/2020 this program no longer works. I assume this is due to a TransportAPI update since the initial
writing of the program. I may update it in future, but for now the code serves its purpose as a portfolio piece.

### Usage
----
Route Planner takes 2 arguments, the current address and the target address.
e.g >> routePlanner.py "My House A12 3BC" "My Other House C32 1BC"

### Limitations
----

This project was one of the first things I created when I learnt about API's (aka a long time ago),
so its limitations are pretty endless...
1. Doesn't work on mobile as its a python script
2. Doesn't interact with GPS module to get current location
3. Text Based = Incredibly Dangerous
4. No UI at all
5. And So On...
